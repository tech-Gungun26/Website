    <h2>About Meerabai DSEU</h2>

        The Maharani Bagh campus of DSEU is strategically located to provide easy access to students from across Delhi. Being very close to Delhi Metro’s Pink and Magenta line along with the frequent facility of busses and availability of last mile connectivity makes commuting for students very convenient.

        Lying in the South-East district of Delhi with localities such as New Friends Colony, Kilokri and Okhla very close to the campus, it is surrounded by various opportunities such as hospitals, industries and other retail outlets. With the cyber spaces of Noida well linked by the Delhi Metro, the campus is well suited for nearby students looking to build a future in digital marketing and other hospitality opportunities. Opportunities of all sorts are plentiful, with the institute surrounded by major Delhi hospitals, such as Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals and the All India Institute of Ayurveda, an acclaimed Okhla Industrial Area and other spirited local markets home to major multinational brands.

    <h2>History of Meerabai DSEU</h2>
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, this institute remained to be known as Women’s Polytechnic from 1962 – 1994 for 32 years and most of our old students still remember it as Women’s Polytechnic. However, in 1994 our name was changed to Meera Bai Polytechnic until 2010, that is, for 16 years.
        

        However, in 2010, on introduction of a BBA course which is a degree course affiliated to Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, the Polytechnic was renamed Meera Bai Institute of Technology. Thus, we have always been a known entity in the world of meaningful education for girls.
